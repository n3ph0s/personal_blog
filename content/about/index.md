Hi there!

I'm David Robinson, the Managing Partner and Practice Lead for Cloud & Cybersecurity at [&How Intelligence](https://www.andhowintelligence.com), a specialist consulting company headquartered in Singapore.

I'm passionate about learning and security, especially OSINT, social engineering, and offensive security. I believe that the best way to improve your knowledge and understanding is to write about it and share it with others.

That's why I'm starting this blog. I want to document my learnings and share them with the world. I hope that my blog will be a resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about security, or who is simply curious about the mind of a hacker.

When I'm not hacking or learning about security, I'm a husband and father. If you've ever been on a call with me when I'm at home, you've probably heard my kids in the background!

I hope you enjoy my blog. Thanks for taking the time to read it!
