I can't believe it's been over two years since I made the switch from Apple to Linux. It was a great decision, and I haven't looked back.

At first, I used PopOS, a Linux distribution known for its tiling window manager. I liked PopOS, but I wanted a more customized and streamlined experience. So, I decided to move away from desktop environments altogether and switch to a tiling window manager on Debian 12.

## Why ditch the desktop environment?

Desktop environments are collections of software applications that provide the graphical user interface (GUI) for Linux operating systems. They include the desktop, taskbar, menus, windows, and other visual elements.

But desktop environments can also be bloated and resource-intensive. If you're looking for a more minimalist and lightweight computing experience, a tiling window manager may be a better option.

Tiling window managers don't come with a pre-built GUI. Instead, they give you complete control over how your windows are arranged on the screen. This can be more efficient and productive than using a desktop environment, especially if you're working with multiple windows at the same time.

## My tiling window manager journey

I tried a few different tiling window managers before settling on i3. i3 is well-documented, highly configurable, and meets my needs perfectly.

But there are many other great tiling window managers available, such as Awesome Windows Manager, BSPWM, DWM, Qtile, and XMonad. If you're interested in trying a tiling window manager, I encourage you to experiment and find one that's right for you.

## Setting up a tiling window manager

Setting up a tiling window manager can be a bit of a learning curve. But it's worth it for the benefits of a more minimalist and efficient computing experience.

## Here are a few tips:

- Start by choosing a tiling window manager that's right for you. Consider your needs and workflow when choosing a window manager.
- Once you've chosen a tiling window manager, read the documentation and tutorials. This will help you learn how to use the window manager and configure it to your liking.
- Don't be afraid to experiment. Tiling window managers are highly customizable, so there's no right or wrong way to use them. Try different configurations and find what works best for you.

## Conclusion

I've been using a tiling window manager on Debian 12 for a few months now, and I'm very happy with the switch. It's given me a more minimalist, efficient, and productive computing experience.  

If you're looking for a way to improve your Linux workflow, I encourage you to try a tiling window manager. It may take some time to get used to, but it's worth it in the end.  Feel free to check out my [configuration](https://github.com/n3ph0s/debian-n3ph0s) which I will be updating periodically.
