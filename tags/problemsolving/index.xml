      <description>Last week I had a small accident that left me hindered for a few days as I was recovering, and due to the nature of the injury, I had to lie down on my side. I took this time to catch up on reading and watched some TV as wasn&amp;rsquo;t really in a position to do much more over the weekend.
While all this was happening, I was thinking to myself; I don&amp;rsquo;t need this, I have enough problems that I need to sort out.</description>
